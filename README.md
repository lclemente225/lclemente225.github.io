# Welcome to my portfolio github
It's an absolute mess because I used this to learn many different tools and skills. It was super helpful with learning responsive web design, inline-css, animations, routing in React and color schemes.

### This github contains the projects from this portfolio and more!
I have many other unfinished projects on this github. Go ahead and explore. I have some pinned projects on my profile page that show my experiments and learning.
